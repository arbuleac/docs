### **3.1 Overview**

The **Statistics** dashboard includes two primary panels:

- **Global activity**\
  Displays the total number of allowed and blocked DNS requests within the last 30 days.
  - **Allowed:** Requests successfully resolved through HeyShield’s filtering system.
  - **Blocked:** Requests blocked due to being categorized as malicious, suspicious, or restricted.
- **Top domains**\
  Lists domains that were blocked most frequently, along with their respective categories and the number of blocked attempts.

### **3.2 Usage Notes**

- The statistics update automatically based on the latest DNS activity from connected devices.
- Data is stored for a 30-day rolling period.
- If no devices are currently added or filtering is disabled, the dashboard will show zeros for both **Allowed** and **Blocked** counts.
