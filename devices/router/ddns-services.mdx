title: "Using DDNS services"
description: "Dynamic DNS (DDNS) services provide a very useful feature for home/residential routers, especially if your internet connection uses a dynamic public IP address (which most ISP's assign)."
---

Most modern home routers (from brands like TP-Link, ASUS, Netgear, or Synology) have **built-in DDNS clients**, supporting services such as:

- **No-IP**
- **DynDNS**
- **DuckDNS**
- **TP-Link Cloud DDNS**, etc.

Present instructions are based on free plan from No-IP ([noip.com](http://noip.com)) and ASUS RT-AC66U residential router, but can be applied very easy to any other combination of DDNS service provider and router brand.
