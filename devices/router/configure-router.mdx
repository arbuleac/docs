There are 2 options to configure router devices:

- using IP address - IP based - usually when ISP assign a static IP than not change in time
- using DDNS hostname - hostname based - when ISP assign a dynamic IP that can change in time without notification

To configure using static IP, click on "User your current IP (xx.xx.xx.xx)", then in your router interface search for WAN connection and under DNS servers section make sure that 1st DNS entry matches the IP address displayed on "DNS servers" on HeyShield interface.

After DNS server check is validated, filtering service will be automatically enabled with some "by default enabled" categories considered as reccommended to offer a minimum protection.

At "WAN DNS Settings" -\> "Connect to DNS Server automatically" select "No" and at "DNS Server1" fill in DNS server IP displayed in DNS Filtering configurations page, and then click "Apply".
